# DAM_Proyecto
Proyecto fin de ciclo de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma DAM.
ItÂ´s a desktop application as an Entreprise Ressource Planning (ERP).
How it works:
1.  Once registered the user can perform activities as creation-modification or elimination of any data. 
The user has access to a table of stock and categories. In this layout, the user has the possibility to create or modify articles which belongs to categories. This part is useful to get an idea of all the assets of a company. It allows the user to quickly see the inventory. Also, an article must be associated to a category. A category and an article can only be created once. This is to avoid any duplicate data in the Database. 
The buys and sells of any articles will only affect his own inventory. 
2.  At last, the user can register an invoice received from a supplier. Numerous articles can be registered in the same invoice, and different VAT tax code can be applied depending on the article. A pdf file can be created from any invoice already registered in the Database. 
To tools involved to create the desktop application are: Eclipse with Java and MySql Workbench.
